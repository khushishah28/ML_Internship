Welcome to my machine learning internship repository! This repository documents my journey through the internship, focusing on two main tasks: iris classification and a movie recommendation system.

**Tasks Included**:

**Iris Classification**:
Implemented SVM and decision tree models for classifying iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on sepal and petal dimensions.
Evaluated model performance using accuracy metrics and visualized decision boundaries.

**Movie Recommendation System**:
Developed a collaborative filtering-based recommendation system for movies.
Preprocessed rating datasets and applied matrix factorization techniques for personalized recommendations.
Evaluated recommendations using RMSE and precision-recall metrics.

**Repository Contents**
**Code:** Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
**Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks demonstrating step-by-step implementations and analysis.
**Datasets:** Provided datasets used for training and evaluation.
**Documentation:** Detailed explanations, insights, and visualizations.
**Technologies Used**
Python, NumPy, Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn for machine learning model implementation.
Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization.
**Future Work**
Enhance model performance through hyperparameter tuning and advanced techniques.
Scale recommendation systems for larger datasets or real-time applications.

**Feel free to explore the code and reach out with any questions or suggestions!**
