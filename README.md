This repository documents my machine learning internship, focusing on two primary tasks:

Iris Classification:

Implemented SVM and decision tree models to classify iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on sepal and petal dimensions.
Evaluated model performance using accuracy metrics and visualized decision boundaries for interpretation.
Movie Recommendation System:

Developed a collaborative filtering-based recommendation system for movies.
Preprocessed rating datasets and applied matrix factorization techniques for personalized recommendations.
Evaluated recommendations using RMSE and precision-recall metrics to assess model effectiveness.
The repository includes Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, datasets, and documentation providing step-by-step implementations and analysis. Future work aims to optimize model performance through advanced techniques and scalability for real-world applications.
