# ML_Internship
This repository serves as documentation for my machine learning internship, focusing on iris classification using SVM and decision trees, and a movie recommendation system employing collaborative filtering with matrix factorization. It includes Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, datasets, and evaluation metrics for both tasks.
